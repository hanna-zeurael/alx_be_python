#( I ) is the interest earned,
#( P ) is the principal amount (initial investment),
#( R ) is the annual interest rate (as a decimal),
#( T ) is the time the money is invested for in years.

principal = 1000  # Principal amount in dollars
rate = 0.05       # Annual interest rate (5%)
time = 3          # Time in years

interest = principal * rate * time  # Calculate simple interest

print("The simple interest is ", interest)  # Output the result
